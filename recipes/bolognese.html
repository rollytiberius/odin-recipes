    <h1>Pasta Bolognese</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/images/spagetti.jpg" alt="Pasta bolognese image">
    <h2>Our Bolognese pasta features a traditional combination of ground beef, pork, veal, and tomato studded with salt-cured pancetta. It's tossed with penne rigate and served with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</h2>
    <p>Bolognese isn't your typical tomato-based spaghetti sauce. It originated in Bologna, Italy, and is a hearty ragù that starts with a soffritto — that all-important blend of finely diced onion, carrot, and celery — loaded up with a variety of ground meats and cooked with white wine. Then, a relatively small amount of tomatoes are added along with stock; the sauce is cooked slow and low to develop and concentrate the flavors. To finish, it's enriched with a touch of cream.</p>
    <p>Because pasta Bolognese sauce is so thick, Italians typically do not eat it with spaghetti, which is too thin to hold everything together. Instead, we serve our sauce with penne rigate, which does a better job of standing up to the robust texture.</p>
    <ul>
        
    <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>1 medium carrot, finely diced</li>
    <li>1 medium celery rib, finely diced</li>
    <li>2 ounces pancetta, thickly sliced, finely diced</li>
    <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 pound ground veal</li>
    <li>1/4 pound ground pork</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
    <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce) can peeled Italian tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped, juices reserved</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken stock or canned low-sodium broth</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 pounds penne rigate</li>
    <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan until shimmering. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Scrape the vegetable mixture into a large bowl.</p>
<p>Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the saucepan and heat until just shimmering. Add the beef, veal, and pork and cook over moderately high heat until just barely pink, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Return the vegetable mixture to the saucepan. Add the garlic and cook over high heat until fragrant, about 1 minute.</p>
<p>Add the wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost evaporated, about 8 minutes.</p>
<p>Stir in the tomatoes and their juices, the chicken stock, thyme, and bay leaf. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and bring to a boil over high heat.</p>
<p>Cover partially and cook over moderately low heat for 1 hour. Discard the bay leaf. Stir in the heavy cream and cook the sauce just until heated through.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente.</p>
<p>Drain well, return to the pot, add the sauce, and toss.</p>
